# INTERNSHIP-2025--MINI-PROJECT2---SIMULATED-BUS-LOCATION-GENERATOR
This Python tool simulates realistic GPS locations for multiple buses, making it ideal for testing live tracking systems, transport dashboards, and mapping applications without needing real-world GPS feeds.
The generator creates random but logical movements for each bus, updating their coordinates every 5 seconds to mimic actual driving patterns. The output is stored in a structured JSON file, which can be easily integrated into other applications or visualized on maps.

Features
Simulates 5 buses with realistic movements.
Updates location data every 5 seconds.
Outputs data in JSON format for easy use in APIs or UI projects.
Clean and modular code with scope for adding more buses or changing speed.
